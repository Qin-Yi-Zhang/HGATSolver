# HGATSolver: A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Solver for Fluid–Structure Interaction
[![HGATSolver](https://img.shields.io/badge/AAAI--2026-accepted-blue)](https://aaai.org/2026/)

## Overview

HGATSolver is a deep learning-based solver designed for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems. Leveraging a heterogeneous graph architecture, HGATSolver addresses the inherent complexities of FSI systems by explicitly encoding physical decomposition into fluid and solid domains, coupled via a dynamic interface. The solver employs **Physics-Conditioned Gating Mechanism (PCGM)** for stability and **Inter-domain Gradient-Balancing Loss (IGBL)** for adaptive training, ensuring robust and efficient simulations across diverse FSI problems.
